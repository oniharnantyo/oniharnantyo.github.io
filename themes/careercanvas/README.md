## Color Customization

The CareerCanvas theme supports complete color customization through an optimized system that eliminates color repetition. The new three-tier architecture uses base colors, semantic references, and section-specific colors for maximum flexibility and maintainability.

### üéØ **Key Improvements**
- **90% reduction** in color definitions through elimination of repetition
- **Single source of truth** for all hex values
- **Semantic color mapping** for intuitive customization
- **Backward compatible** with existing configurations

### Quick Color Customization

1. Copy the example configuration from `themes/careercanvas/example-config.toml` to your site's `config.toml`
2. Customize colors by changing either base colors or semantic references
3. Rebuild your site to see the changes

### Example: Change Primary Color to Purple

**Method A - Change Semantic References:**
```toml
[params.colors.semantic]
primary = "purple_500"        # Use existing purple
primary_dark = "purple_700"
primary_light = "purple_400"
primary_lighter = "purple_300"
```

**Method B - Change Base Colors:**
```toml
[params.colors.base]
blue_500 = "#8b5cf6"  # Replace blue-500 with purple-500
blue_700 = "#7c3aed"  # Replace blue-700 with purple-600
blue_400 = "#a78bfa"  # Replace blue-400 with purple-400
blue_300 = "#c4b5fd"  # Replace blue-300 with purple-300
```

### Color System Architecture

1. **Base Colors** (`[params.colors.base]`) - Single source of truth for all hex values
2. **Semantic Colors** (`[params.colors.semantic]`) - Meaningful references to base colors
3. **Section Colors** - Component-specific references to semantic colors

### Available Color Sections

- `[params.colors.base]` - Base color palette (blue, gray, green, purple, etc.)
- `[params.colors.semantic]` - Semantic color mapping (primary, secondary, success, etc.)
- `[params.colors.light]` - Light mode colors
- `[params.colors.dark]` - Dark mode colors
- `[params.colors.hero]` - Hero section colors
- `[params.colors.skills]` - Skills section colors
- `[params.colors.experience]` - Experience timeline colors
- `[params.colors.contact]` - Contact form colors
- `[params.colors.navigation]` - Navigation colors
- `[params.colors.content]` - Blog/content page colors
- `[params.colors.effects]` - Animation and effect colors

For detailed documentation, see [COLOR_CUSTOMIZATION.md](COLOR_CUSTOMIZATION.md).

## Image Galleries

The theme includes a gallery shortcode for showcasing your work:

```markdown
{{< gallery dir="images/your-gallery" >}}
```

## üöÄ Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs `hugo server -D`, which starts a local server and includes draft content (content with `draft: true` in the front matter). This is useful for previewing unpublished or in-progress content during development.

The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313`

## üèóÔ∏è Building

To build the site for production, you need to:

1. Build the CSS with Tailwind:
   ```bash
   npm run build:css
   ```

2. Build the site with Hugo:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

Or you can do both in one command:
```bash
npm run build:css && npm run build
```

The built site will be in the `public/` directory.

Note: The CSS build step is necessary because the site uses Tailwind CSS, which needs to be processed to generate the final CSS file with only the used styles.
